Hello, 

My name is Daniel Wilson and I am a developer, designer, and overall dingo. I grew up in Traverse City, Michigan with the greatest friends and family one could ask for.

I graduated from Saint Francis High School and nearly went to the United States Coast Guard Academy. However, due to a minor medical issue was I forced to change my plans and attend The University of Michigan at the last minute. 

Over the past few years at Michigan I have met countless incredible people and really grown to love the University and everything it stands for. My freshman year I wrote my first few lines of code and from then on, things have been crazy.

I love everything web, have dabbled with android, and am constantly designing, developing, and goofing off.

In this blog I will write my document my journey through life along with some technical tutorials and personal design thoughts. Hope you enjoy it!

Daniel Wilson
