Hello, in this tutorial we will go over how you can put your Node App up for the world to use for free. 

##Heroku

Heroku is a **Hosting Service** thats supports many platforms of development. In this case we will be using Node.js. It is awesome for putting simple projects out there for **Free** to start, it can get pricey if you want to beef up your speed but great to start with. Here are some great features of Heroku.

*	**Free** - As we mentioned before, Heroku has a free plan which is great for poor college students like myself.

*	**Git Integration** - Heroku allows you to Deploy your Apps using Git. Push your changes up and see them in seconds. My favorite feature by far.

*	**Logging** - If something goes wrong Heroku makes it easy to find your bugs.
