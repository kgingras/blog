For a brief intro, Settlers of Catan is a very popular board game. In this post I will go over some lessons I have learned from playing the game. New players always ask,"What is the best strategy?" THERE IS NONE! That's just what I say because every game is different and the players who abide by one set on laws don't win very often. In my experience, players who use the same strategy often aren't able to follow it based on the games play style. Also, because I generally play with the same people other people will know your strategy. This is not good. Being unpredictable is key. Now let's get to some basics.

#Critical Points

###Picking your Initial Settlements

The best thing you can do in the beginning is maximize the good and minimize the bad. Getting boxed in early will make your chances of winning deacrease heavily so try to spread your settlements out in an effort to claim a part of the board or enable you sort of "fill in the line" between the two and snag longest road first. When placing your second settlement it is often a good idea to place on wood and brick to get a free road. Quick expansion and two "ok" settlements is usually better than one "good" settlement.

* **Role Numbers** - It can be beneficial to find a nice range of numbers rather than a high probability jackpot. This will give you a more consistent stream of resources rather than a massive payout after 7 years of drought. DON'T TUNNEL VISION ON 6 and 8! They are good, but so are 5 and 9.

* **Monopolies** - If you can solidify yourself as the source of one essential resource, all the other players will be at your mercy. Basically, the "Brick Guy" determines the rate at which the game progresses. 

###Diversify your Play

While it's good to play a strategy, a balance of all game elements can be essential. I try to follow some of these helpful tips.

* **Build at least four Settlements** - This is key when the board becomes locked up and your best hope for points is building cities. These are points you can count on compared to depending on Dev Card points or fighting someone for longest road.

* **Always have a Knight ready** - If your having success due to a certain tile, the players will most likely mob you in an effort to shut down your imports and it can be a huge asset to be able to move it right back.

###Changing with the Game

In the beginning, everyone wants to build roads and settlements and that means lumber and that sweet brick are in high demand. However, later in the game when the board is locked up to focus shifts to cities and Dev Cards in the form of wheat and ore. It is helpful to observe this change.

#Styles of Play

In my mind, there are a few roles you can play in the game that give you a good chance of winning. If you decide to follow one of these styles it should be after you place your initial settlements. It will be very hard to be the DEV card guy with no Sheep. If you solidify yourself as this player early, players will not contest you for it.

###Development Card Guy

"Dev Cards" can change a game in the blink of an eye. From moving to robber to straight up winning the game. If you establish yourself as the guy whose gonna go for Dev Cards first, you most likely will pick up **biggest army** and a few **Victory Points** as well. A great asset of this strategy is your ability to conceal your Dev Cards and pull of some game changing surprises. 

###Longest Road Guy

You want to expand your kingdom to the reaches of the earth and that's cool. While this strategy can be costly resource wise, you can set your self up for a great second half of the game. Having an extremely long road not only gives you the two points for longest road but it gives you a lot of space for settlements which can give you access to precious resources you had to barter for in the beginning. 

###Port Trading Guy

With a high frequency resource next to a 2:1 port of the corresponding type, you can build quite the trade post enabling you to get a diverse array of resources early in the game.

###City Guy
This is one of the more risky strategies, but can have huge payoff. Placing your first two settlements on a combination of wheat and ore, as well as your second settlement giving you some free wheat/ore will make it likely you can build a City in one of the first two rotations. This will implement what I call the brute snowball. A mix between brute force and snowball. Early on you will be gaining approximately double the cards as the other players (snowball effect). Then even if you don't have any special ports you can still easily make the 4:1 port trades to gain expansion materials (brute force).
