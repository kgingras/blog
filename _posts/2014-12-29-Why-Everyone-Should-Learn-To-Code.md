##My Story

Before I came to Michigan, I had never written a line of code. I can still remember the first lab of my intro to programming course freshman year. I was confused, frustrated, and felt like everyone there was smarter than I. For myself, this was the greatest difficulty in my computer science career, starting.

But after sticking it out, I found coding to be interesting, fun, and useful. The first **non-"Hello World"** program I wrote was a trajectory calculator. I remember looking at it with pride

##Things I've Learned

My father taught me the lesson that no matter what you do or how hard you work, there will always be someone better than you, and that's perfectly fine. Especially at an awesome school like Michigan. There are kids in my classes who could code circles around me and I accept that. 

Because if you make developing soley about winning, then you've already lost.
