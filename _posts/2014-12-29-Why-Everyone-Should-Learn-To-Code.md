**I had never coded in high school** and looking back I really wish I would've have tried it out then. No classes were programming classes were offered at my high school and then it seem weird and nerdy. Looking back, I feel so silly for thinking that way and I'm here to confirm that **the ability to code** is one of the **coolest and most powerful abilities** someone can have.

In today's world, you can **build, manage, and run a company** with a laptop and the Internet. This incredible power is available to **anyone with the courage to make it happen**.

##You have all you need to start

Today, you have access to everything you need: passionate teachers, detailed tutorials, and incredible technologies, all free and accessible online! With these resources you can **literally** build the next facebook with skills learned online. 

##Starting is the Hardest

For myself, the toughest point in my career as a developer, was the beginning. I remember being in my freshman intro to programming lab feeling like a **muggle** who just couldn't produce the magic other kids were able to. I stuck with it and became best friends with the expanse of knowledge that exists on the Internet.

##Learning to Learn

Even more so than coding, being able to learn on your own might be the **greatest skill of all**. This enables you to be a dynamic professional, constantly learning new skills and developing yourself along with awesome applications. 

I don't have a ton of industry experience, but from the people I've spoken with, Software is such a fast moving field that one must be constantly learning to stay up to date with the cutting edge. This being said, the importance of the ability to pick up something quickly is immeasurable.

##How I would start

If I was just beginning, I would start with making a simple website. It's a simple project that you can sit back, look at and say, **I made this**. Nothing is more inspirational to me than seeing something go from idea to implementation. I think I'll make a Blog Post about building your first website.

##Don't Give up

It is easy to get discouraged especially when it feels like you're not as good at it as others, but **Don't Worry**, just focus on learning yourself. Be the best you can be and never doubt that you have the ability to become a great developer and make incredible things.

##Conclusion

I understand that not everyone **loves coding**, in fact I'm good friends with people to **harbor deep hatred for it**. I think it's important that people pursue what they love. That's probably the most awesome thing someone can do. 

If you want to get started in coding, I've included some good links to get up and running. Hopefully I make that Blog Post soon.

**Fun fact:** About a 1.5 years ago I was clicking one of the links and just beginning, now I'm writing this post today. Hopefully y
