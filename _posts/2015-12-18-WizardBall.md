**The creation of a game doesn't just happen**. Each game starts out as a prototype. When the WizardBall prototype was finished we didn't know the potential of what the product could be. Team Beetleborg knew it would be easy to learn with naturally competitive gameplay.



##Set Aside Time

One of my good friends once told me, "You'll never finish something unless you give yourself a deadline". We make time in our lives for the things we care about. Similar to exercise and other things, if you want to do it, you will find time to do it. I like to set aside a certain of the week where me and my friend will just work on projects, explore new things, and look at each others work. Developing together is a powerful thing. Looking at a project from two perspectives can really improve your understanding of it.

##Break It Into Pieces

Work on a project feature by feature. Not only will this modularize your understanding of the project but improve your workflow as well. Too many times I've been sitting at my laptop trying to build a whole application and I've just felt lost. When you break your project into smaller sub-projects you get the gratification of the sort-of "small wins", little victories that contribute to an overall awesome application.

This is how a lot of companies do development. You have to act as your own manager, assigning features and other jobs to yourself and if your working with a team, you'll have to communicate with everyone to make sure you're working effectively.

##Work with Others

As I said earlier, it can be a great experience to work either as a team or alongside other developers. You can find a lot of help on the web but when you're stuck few things are more effective than having someone talk through your code with you. It also just makes it a lot more fun for me. You get to see the cool things people are working on and offer them your advice as well as get feedback on your projects.

##Conclusion

The more you develop, the better you will become at it, so keep working and go make something awesome!
