It's great to be done with semester, I'll be the first one to say it. The climax of stress at the end of the semester is unbelievable but it seems to be the baptism by fire for the semester. Anyway, I'm back in my hometown of **Traverse City, MI** with my wonderful family and friends. 

##Gaming

We just finished three incredibly intense sessions of the game **Settlers of Catan**, an extremely well made game that will have the best of friends throwing punches in minutes. That being said, it's a fun time regardless of how competitive you are. I also spent some good time with my brother on the always timeless [Miniclip.com](http://miniclip.com). Where I sadly spend a good deal of my childhood.

##Hiking

Today I went for a hike with my sister in the wintery wasteland that exists outside. My sister has this odd zeal for going on hikes in very harsh conditions. 

##Fashion

Normally I'm not the one to talk about clothes or even say the word "Fashion", but after being good friends with two dangerously well dressed guys from Pittsburg, I have become more aware to the benifits of fashion over function. 

After a large shopping endevour financed by the perpetually wealthy Santa Claus, I am now the owner of five pairs of **Joggers** and one of those big coates with fur hoods. I will say the coat was from **Old Navy** and only $40 so yeah.

##New Years

In Traverse City we do this wierd thing called the **Cherry Ball Drop** which is similar to the NYC Ball Drop but with a light-up cherry that is .001 * the size. Our small downtown block becomes packed with people longing to see this beautiful ruby orb to the point where they start climbing stuff. It should be an interesting endevour and if anything crazy happens I will mention it later most likely. 

##Conclusion

While this post may or may not have been just to fill up space in this relatively young blog, I hope you enjoyed at least a small fraction of it. Merry Christmas and Happy New Years ya filthy animal.
