A big thank you to the Wilson brothers! Patrick and Dan Wilson have been so help with my transition into Computer Science. I am so much happier doing something that I love now. They have inspired and helped me along the way. It has been 2 years jam packed with everything Computer Science. You've helped me start projects and learn many new things.
