**What's there to know about me?** Well, I love code, I love code that WORKS, I love sports, I love games and I love how games can deliver incredible experiences. That's a lot of loves you say? Well, I am a passionate guy.

Technically speaking, I am a from [Traverse City, MI](http://traversecity.com) who wants to change the world through technology. I am constantly developing projects on my own and with others while I study Computer Science at the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu).

I believe that anyone can code, and like [Settlers of Catan](http://catan.com), everyone should at least **try it**. I write this [Blog](http://kgingras.github.io/blog/) in hopes of helping, encouraging, and maybe inspiring those making their way down the path I took. 

##Organizations

**Wolverine Soft**, a very diverse group on campus that specializes in designing and developing all types of games. I am joining this semester and very excited!

**Student Food co.**, A small group that brings affordable produce to students on the Central Campus Diag.

##Hobbies

**Games** - I love the possibilites that games can have and they are really fun. I believe everyone hasa favorite game or has at least had fun playing one. Whether it's card games, board games, or video games.

**Hackathons** - Gotta love that "We'll do it live" mentality while working through the night until **It just works**. Regular attendee of [MHacks](http://mhacks.org).

**Water** - Growing up with lakes everywhere I've always loved being on the water. Jumping off the boat in the middle of Traverse East Bay is always exilerating.

##Disclaimer

I do not pretend to be the smartest guy in the world, in fact I am always ready to learn from people. If you see a flaw in a post by all means let me know (even if you wanna just discuss it). I love learning more about cool stuff!

I truly hope you enjoy your time here in our little corner of the web! All the best!
