I have a laptop and connection to the Internet! This is what I've been able to create so far.

[Tools for Modeling and Analysis of Cell Penetrating Molecules](http://cellpm.org/) - An online tool for... well modeling and analysis of Cell Penetrating Molecules. I worked with Professors Lomize and Pogozheva to design and create the website. Please don't ask me in depth about the proteins. I'm just the Dev guy!

```
HTML, CSS
```

[Membranome](http://membranome.org/) - In addition to creating CellPM.org, I also worked on the Membranome database. I wrote programs to analyze the 6000+ proteins and compare them to the output of 3 other prediction tools. The results were able to spot gaps of missing information and show some bugs in the Prediction software.

```
C++
```

[Pixel Survivor](http://kgingras.github.io/PixelSurvivor/PixelSurvivor) Pixel Survivor is my attempt to rapidly prototype a new game mechanic. The player must destroy or "pixelate" the environment around him with his light cannon to survive against constant waves of enemies. This is my first time creating a Firt Person Shooter and I had lot of fun making it and learning new features of Unity.
```
Unity, C#
```


[Pokemon](http://kgingras.github.io/Pokemon/PokemonFinalWebBuild/PokemonFinal) In my game design class we had a Pokemon project. The goal was to recreate the "classic level" of pokemon. Because I love pokemon, I took it further by creating the initial questline and allowing pokemon to evolve. This is still a work in progress and I will try to have it on the site soon.

```
Unity, C#
```

##Work Experience

* **Programmer, College of Pharmacy**, [Tools for Modeling and Analysis of Cell Penetrating Molecules](http://cellpm.org/) - Throughout the summer of 2015 I worked to create CellPM.org and find  bugs in the Membranome database. I gained more experience in using HTML, CSS, C++, SQL, and some exposure to PHP.

* **Cherry Crew Leader**, **Cherry Ke Inc.** - While this work was suprisingly non-technical, working 12 hour night shifts in a cherry orchard 6 days a week gave me true appreciation for hard work. I met some incredible people and gained the most valuable leadership experience as a yound high-school student.
