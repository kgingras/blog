I have a laptop and connection to the Internet! This is what I've been able to create so far. 

#[DiscoCloud](http://discocloud.herokuapp.com) (in progress)

Ever heard of a **Silent Disco**? now you and your friends can share music and the beat!

**Tech** - (SoundCloud API, Node.js, ExpressJS, Socket.io, AngularJS)

* [BlitzBlock](http://goo.gl/zqblW9) is a fun fast paced tapping native Android game. My first major project in my life, this game incoporated fun aspects from games I had played before into an exciting game that features medals, high-scores, and other fun elements.

* [Delivice](https://delivice.github.io) is a landing page I created for a local Ann Arbor startup providing grocery delivery for students and residence. I did all the design and development associated with the page as well as the icon design. They're a great group of people and I hope to do more with them in the future.

##Smaller Projects

[Michigan Today](http://goo.gl/zqblW9) was my first ever application created. Built at my first hackathon. It was extremely simple but showed me the unlimited possibilities that come from development. It inspired me to learn more and work harder.

##Work Experience

* **Lead Web Developer**, *Delivice* - Designed and Developed landing page, currently working on migrating existing web application to a new platform.

* **Web Developer Intern**, *Hagerty Collector Car Insurance* - At Hagerty I developed an automated testing framework and application using Selenium-WebDriver that is used to this day. It was a great opportunity to see Software Development in a business centered environment and work with amazingly talented Developers and QA engineers. 

* **Cook**, *That'sa Pizza* - While this work was suprisingly not technical, working in a pizza kitchen gave me a true appreciation for hard work and allowed me to meet incredible and inspirational people who have affected my life for the better in so many ways.
