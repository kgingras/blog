##The Big Ones

[DiscoCloud](http://discocloud.herokuapp.com) is a web application where users can partake in a silent disco. It uses the SoundCloud api for music streams and other web technologies such as Node.js, ExpressJS and Socket.io. Currently Hosted on Heroku. I am very passionate about music and sharing it. I think there is something very special in experiencing a song in rythm with another person. DiscoCloud allows them to do so.

[BlitzBlock](http://goo.gl/zqblW9) is a fun fast paced tapping native Android game. My first major project in my life, this game incoporated fun aspects from games I had played before into an exciting game that features medals, high-scores, and other fun elements.

[Delivice](https://delivice.github.io) is a landing page I created for a local Ann Arbor startup providing grocery delivery for students and residence. I did all the design and development associated with the page as well as the icon design. They're a great group of people and I hope to do more with them in the future.
