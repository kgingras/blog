##The Big Ones

[DiscoCloud](http://discocloud.herokuapp.com) is a web application where users can partake in a silent disco. It uses the SoundCloud api for music streams and other web technologies such as Node.js, ExpressJS and Socket.io. Currently Hosted on Heroku. I am very passionate about music and sharing it. I think there is something very special in experiencing a song in rythm with another person. DiscoCloud allows them to do so.

[BlitzBlock](http://goo.gl/zqblW9) is a fun fast paced tapping native Android game. My first major project in my life, this game incoporated fun aspects from games I had played before into an exciting game that features medals, high-scores, and other fun elements.

[Delivice](https://delivice.github.io) is a landing page I created for a local Ann Arbor startup providing grocery delivery for students and residence. I did all the design and development associated with the page as well as the icon design. They're a great group of people and I hope to do more with them in the future.

##Smaller Projects

[Michigan Today](http://goo.gl/zqblW9) was my first ever application created. Built at my first hackathon. It was extremely simple but showed me the unlimited possibilities that come from development. It inspired me to learn more and work harder.
